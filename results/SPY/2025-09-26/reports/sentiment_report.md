I am sorry, but I was unable to retrieve news for SPY using the available tools. The `get_stock_news_openai` tool encountered a `FileNotFoundError`, suggesting it might not be able to process ETFs like SPY, as it is designed for individual company tickers (e.g., AAPL, TSM). Therefore, I cannot provide a report on social media sentiment and news for SPY at this time.
