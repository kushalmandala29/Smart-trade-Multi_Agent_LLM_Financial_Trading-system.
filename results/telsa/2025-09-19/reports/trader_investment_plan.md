Based on the provided investment plan and my analysis, I concur with the recommendation to sell. The overbought RSI, bearish short-term signals, and increasing competition all point towards a potential correction. The plan's emphasis on risk management and the strategic actions outlined are sound. The commitment to re-evaluate the position after the initial sell, and the learning from past mistakes, further solidify the decision.

FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **SELL**
